A WPF-based Windows application that creates a secure SOCKS5 proxy tunnel to a remote server. It's designed to be a simple, graphical alternative to the `ssh -D` or `ssh -L` command.

This project utilizes the excellent [SSH.NET](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET) library.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Profile Management**: Save and manage multiple SSH server configurations.
* **One-Click Connection**: Easily connect or disconnect with a single button.
* **Visual Status Indicator**: Instantly know your connection status with color-coded feedback.
* **Customizable Proxy**: Configure the local SOCKS5 IP address and port.
* **Light & Dark Themes**: Match the app to your system's theme.
* **Connection Logs**: A dedicated panel for real-time logs to troubleshoot connection issues.

## üîß Usage Guide

The application interface is designed to be intuitive, with sections arranged from top to bottom.

### 1. Server Configuration

Before connecting, you need to add a server profile.

1.  Click **Edit Configurations**.
2.  In the new window, provide the following details:
    * **Name**: A friendly name for your configuration (e.g., "Work Server").
    * **Host Address**: The IP address or domain of the SSH server (e.g., `123.123.123.123`).
    * **Host Port**: The SSH port on the server. The default is `22`.
    * **Username & Password**: Your credentials for the SSH server.
3.  Click **Add** to save the new profile. You can also select a profile from the list to **Edit** or **Delete** it.

### 2. Connection Button

The main button serves to connect/disconnect and shows the current status:

* **üü¢ Spinning**: Connecting to the host.
* **üü¢ Solid**: Successfully connected.
* **üü° Spinning**: An error occurred; attempting to reconnect.
* **üî¥ Solid**: Disconnected due to an unrecoverable error.

**NOTE**: Make sure to select a profile from the list, before clicking on connect!

### 3. SOCKS5 Properties

This section controls the local proxy created by the tunnel. Other applications on your PC can be configured to use this proxy.

* **SOCKS5 IP Address**: Defaults to `127.0.0.1` (localhost).
* **SOCKS5 Port**: Defaults to `1080`.

You can change these values if the default address is already in use or if you have specific networking needs.

### 4. SSH Connection Properties

Here you can adjust advanced SSH parameters like the Keep-Alive interval. **It is recommended to leave these at their default values** unless you are an advanced user and know why you need to change them.

### 5. Logs

This panel displays real-time output from the SSH connection. It is essential for **debugging** any connectivity problems. If you encounter an issue, the information here will be very helpful.
